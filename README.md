## ðŸ§  Idea
This script was created as a playful way to let users:
- Write their personal wishes.
- Decide how many wishes they want to add.
- Optionally add a final wish at the end.
- Sort all the wishes alphabetically.
- Remove a wish if they change their mind.

## ðŸ›  How to Use
1. Run the script using any Python interpreter.
2. You'll be asked to enter your name.
3. Then enter how many wishes you'd like to add.
4. After entering your wishes, you can:
   - Add one last wish if you like.
   - Sort and review your wishes.
   - Remove any wish if needed.
